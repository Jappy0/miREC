Here is 12 preprocessed salmon data downloaded from NCBI.

The original datasets can be downloaded at the link (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov//bioproject/PRJNA202973), with the Accession Number PRJNA202973.

We do cut adapter and use fastqc tool to test data quality.

So we provided 12 fastq files after adapter cutting, named cut_ID*.fastq and its quality detail named cut_ID*_fastqc.html.

The fastq files are too large to upload at github, but you still can access it from goolge drive. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PqkDgzLzDNjCIJdue9Euon6WiLDrAlUF/view?usp=sharing)
