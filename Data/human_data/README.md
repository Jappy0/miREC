Here two types of human miRNA datasets from human beta cells and human brain samples.

Two  human  miRNA  datasets  are  derivedfrom human beta cells in extracellular vesicles. These datasetsare incubated with solution of low glucose (2 mM) and highglucose  (20  mM)  respectively  for  comparison.  

Two  humanmiRNA  datasets  from  brain  samples  are  related  to  post-mortem alzheimerâ€™s disease. One dataset is from a controlled 75 male (SRR12881030) and the other is from an uncontrolled 94 male (SRR12881018). 

The original datasets can be downloaded at the NCBI, with the Accession Number SRP296813 and SRP288246.

We do cut adapter and use fastqc tool to test data quality.

So we provided 4 fastq files after adapter cutting, named cut_18/cut_30/cut_highlow/cut_high.fastq.

The fastq files are too large to upload at github, but you still can access it from goolge drive. (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1H8yPiPYMNiIvS-LEnmlQIqDNrboBI169/view?usp=sharing)
