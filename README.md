# miREC
An error correction tool for miRNA reads at single-base resolution, which proposed a novel 3-layer lattice structure combining kmers, (k-1)mers and (k+1)mers to first time solve the problem of correcting erroneous bases in miRNA sequencing data. 
The novelty of our method is the use of a 3-layer (k-1)mer-kmer-(k+1)mer lattice structure to maintain the frequency differences of the kmers.
The method is particularly effective for the accurate correction of indel errors. 

Our miREC is a user-friendly tool and suits for different research needs. It provides sev- eral parameters for users to specify according to specific tasks. Three most useful settings are: the error types, the frequency threshold τ, and the kmer range [k_1,k_end]. Our miREC has two running modes. One is for the substitution error correction only, the other is Unlike the exist- ing methods which use a fixed threshold, miREC provides options to obtain a good threshold to identify erroneous kmers, thereby avoiding over-correction or insufficient performance when datasets change.  

## Dependancies
KMC3 tool, a kmer counter, is used to obtain kmer frequences. Here is the instruction of KMC3 (http://sun.aei.polsl.pl/REFRESH/kmc).

## Download & Usage

	git clone https://github.com/XuanrZhang/miREC
	cd miREC
	make
	chmod +x miREC.sh
	./miREC.sh -f [File_Name] -s [k_1] -e [k_end] -t [threshold_value] [run_type]
	e.g 
	./miREC.sh -f input.fq -t 5 -s 8 -e 20  (correct substitution and indel errors, with threshold_value 5 and k_value from 8 to 20)
	./miREC.sh -f input.fq -t 5 -s 8 -e 20  (correct substitution errors only, with threshold_value 5 and k_value from 8 to 20)
	
	
Usage: ./miREC.sh -f [File_Name] -s [k_1] -e [k_end] -t [threshold_value] [run_type]

	Required OPTIONS:
	-f [File_Name]: cleaned miRNA sequence dataset （fastq file）

	Optional OPTIONS:
	-t [threshold_value]: default is 5;
	-s [k_1]: 10
	-e [k_end]: 20
	[run_type]: default is mix, "-o" for substitution errors only;
	
  
## Data format
Input: A read dataset in fastq format

	- reads.fq : store the whole read data needed to be corrected.
	
Output: A corrected read dataset 

	- corrected.fq :store corrected read data.
